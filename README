= VoragineDB -- General information =

Voragine db its a db project based on lastest vertion of CTDB for 3.3.5a,
we want to create a very good db based in our work and info extracted from
different sources included blizz.

We will release DB like every 2 weeks with a lot of updates, fixes and changes
we will not put updates for world db in db repo because we dont want to have
leechers (people that copy our commits but dont give us our proper credit).

If you want to help us with some fixes and try to help in db development,
go to our forum and make a db patch submision.
